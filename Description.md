# Hasshadai: A Revolutionary Launchpad for Edu Blockchain Project
We realized that the current problem with launchpads is that users don't really understand the projects they will buy into. Launchpads often prioritize their token holders to participate, and that leads to people who really see the vision of the project not being able to participate in the launchpad. I wanted to create a launchpad that would prioritize people who really understand and believe in to the project. 

We created the learn-tier as a mandatory part for many people. They will read the project documents and then answer the questions. If they answer all the questions correctly, they will have the right to participate in buying tokens from the project.
