# Hasshadai: The Next-Generation Launchpad for Educational Blockchain Projects

### Addressing the Challenge
Current launchpads often fall short in fostering true understanding among participants. They tend to favor token holders over those who genuinely grasp and support the project’s vision, leaving knowledgeable and passionate individuals sidelined. Hasshadai is designed to change this dynamic by prioritizing informed participants who deeply understand and believe in the projects they are investing in.

### Our Unique Approach
At Hasshadai, we’ve introduced the **Learn-Tier** system, a mandatory educational process where participants engage with project documentation and complete a series of questions. Only those who demonstrate full comprehension by answering all questions correctly earn the right to participate in the token sale.

### Key Features of Hasshadai

- **Edu Blockchain Integration:** Harnessing the power of blockchain to create a secure, transparent, and immutable environment for educational projects.
- **Open Campus OIDC Verification:** By utilizing OpenID Connect (OIDC) for user authentication, Hasshadai ensures that only verified and authentic users can participate in token sales, enhancing platform integrity.
- **Targeted Token Sales:** Unlike traditional launchpads, Hasshadai focuses on selling tokens to individuals who prove their understanding of the project, fostering a community of engaged and informed investors.
- **Smart Contract Bootstrapping:** Hasshadai offers an interactive interface for building smart contracts. Users can select the contract type (e.g., ERC20 or ERC721), set parameters such as token name, symbol, and premint amount, and generate the complete smart contract code.

### Benefits of Using Hasshadai

- **Curated Quality Projects:** Hasshadai’s focus on educational blockchain initiatives ensures that only high-potential, impactful projects are listed, making it a hub for revolutionary educational advancements.
- **Informed Investor Base:** Our unique learn-to-earn approach ensures that participants are well-informed, creating a community of knowledgeable supporters and reducing speculative investments.
- **Enhanced Security:** Through Open Campus OIDC verification, Hasshadai adds an extra layer of security, minimizing risks of fraud and ensuring a trustworthy environment for all users.
